//! A simple heap based on a buddy allocator.  For the theory of buddy
//! allocators, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation
//!
//! The basic idea is that our heap size is a power of two, and the heap
//! starts out as one giant free block.  When a memory allocation request
//! is received, we round the requested size up to a power of two, and find
//! the smallest available block we can use.  If the smallest free block is
//! too big (more than twice as big as the memory we want to allocate), we
//! split the smallest free block in half recursively until it's the right
//! size.  This simplifies a lot of bookkeeping, because all our block
//! sizes are a power of 2, which makes it easy to have one free list per
//! block size.
